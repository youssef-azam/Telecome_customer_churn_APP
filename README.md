# Telecome_customer_churn_APP
Telecom customer churn prediction is a project that aims to predict whether a customer will stay with a telecom company or leave (churn) based on their usage behavior, demographic information, and other factors. The project typically involves analyzing a large dataset of customer information, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and training a machine learning model to make predictions. The goal is to identify customers who are at high risk of churning so that the company can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering incentives, discounts, or better service. The project can help telecom companies reduce customer churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.
